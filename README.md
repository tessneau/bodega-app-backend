# üè¨ La Bodega API üè¨

## Installation

```
bundle install
rails db:migrate && rails db:seed
rails s
```
Copy the resulting url listed as `Listening on [url]` (often it will be localhost:3000), paste the url into your browser & voila. If there are problems, start by checking that the data has seeded by running `rails c`, then `User.all`

## Usage
La Bodega API is needed in order to accept HTTP requests from it's frontend La Bodega. This allows users to:
* Create, read, and update their accounts with the help of JavaScript Web Tokens and Bcrypt.
* Manipulate a user's cart by adding, deleting, and updating cart item instances.
* Have access to seeded produce and their categories. 
* Available paths are /api/v1/users, /api/v1/categories, /api/v1/items, /api/v1/profile, and more to be found in the config/routes file
